## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Landing Page
  * Mack Scott was able to outline and design the Web Application's Landing Page. This page is used as the introduction page when a user accesses the webpage. This landing page will provide the viewer with the budget application info, and will be the source for user login.
  --Please refer to the Completed Issues folder *Issue_14
* Login Interface
  * Blake Burns was able to design and implement a login interface, in css and html code, in which the user can interact and sign into the web application with an email and a password. This interface is the first thing that the user will see when they arrive to the web page and login to the application. --Please refer to the Money_Channel_Wireframe folder; *Money_Channel_User_Login.css *Money_Channel_User_Login.html
* Notifications Page
  * Christian Coulter designed a page that shows the user of important events happening with their budgeting account. These notifications would provide information on withdrawals and deposits, and provide the user with the option to clear them.

## Retrospective
* What Went Well or maybe not?
  * Team: 
     * The team worked great together.
     * Everyone on the team was open to ideas.
     * Teammates were as flexible as possible when it came to meeting times.
     * We were able to develop a working prototype.
  * Individual:
     * Mack: I was able to work will with the team, and act as a team lead to facilitate all of our task.
     * Blake: The team really works well together. Everyone gets along great!   
     * Christian: The team did a good job sharing their tasks so that others could implement them on their own computers.
     * Zach: Spacing out the work time allowed me to better focus on the tasks assigned to me.
     * Muhammed: Sharing ideas and agreeing on a similiar goal was a smooth process.
* What Might Be Impeding Us from Performing Better?
  * Finding the time so that the whole team is able to meet together to stay on top, and see that tasks are being completed in     an efficient manner.
* What Can We do to Improve?
  * Team:
     * Set a scheduled meeting time each week that works with every member of the team.
  * Individual:
     * Mack: I believe that we can improve our project by creating the html and css code for this project, as this is not currently in place. This can be measured by the distribution of tasks to each team member and working diligently on each code one at a time.
     * Blake: I need to find a time where I can sit down and talk with the team to explain what progress I have made. 
     * Christian: Identify the tasks and the days I need to complete them in order to stay on schedule with the sprint timeline. 
     * Zach: Better document what I have done and update the read me with it, and what I plan on doing.
     * Muhammed: I need to get better at javascript so that I can connect the front end part of my web page to the back end.
