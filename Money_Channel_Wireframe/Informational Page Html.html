<h1>What is Budgeting?</h1>
 <p>Budgeting is a way of prioritizing your spending through careful planning and organizing. This planning process lays out where all of your money goes. Budgeting can be accomplished by this general framework of three parts: money for expenses, money for saving, and money for everything else. Good budgeting is spending less than you are earning as you plan for your financial goals.</p>

<h1>Reasons why you should budget your money</h1>
<p>A budget helps you figure out your long-term goals and work towards them. A budget forces you to map out your goals, save your money, keep track of your progress, and make your dreams a reality. It ensures you don't spend money that you don't have. Building a budget forces you to take a close look at your spending habits. You may notice that you're spending money on things that you no longer use</p>
